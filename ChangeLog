	* Fixed bug with wrong application updating the desktop background.

	* Made MiNT specific makefiles. Use make -f Makefile.mint to build
	with gcc under MiNT.

	* I've decided to release 0.90. Please note that this is no stable
	version, but more a test version. Don't run anything important
	under it.

	* A lot has been changed since 0.80. oAESis has been converted
	into a real client/server system where the "trap library" is the
	client part. The AES API is not the same as the oAESis server
	interface. The main reason for this is to be compatible with
	memory protection, ie since resources and menus are owned by the
	application they have to be handled by the client part. Things
	like messaging and events are handled by the server. Unfortunately
	some things that should be implemented with shared memory are not
	finished on the MiNT side. Hopefully they will be until the next
	version.
