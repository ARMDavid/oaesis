---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Version 0.5, January 31st 1996.

Finally a binary version of oAESis is available! It is, however, not 
completely compatible with MultiTOS yet since some calls are missing and 
others not complete. Some programs can be used with oAESis 0.5: Pure C 
(when it actually starts, that is), QED (I'm writing this text with it 
running under oAESis :-)) and lines.prg (!) to mention a few.

Version 0.6, March 3rd 1996.

Pure C now runs like a charm! I found the deadlock bug in the menu_bar
implementation that made the system hang now and then. More programs
can be run: Diamond Edge, Everest, Talking Clock, Calappt, Toswin, CAB,
xcontrol (as an application. Hi Craig :-).) and Gemini.

Version 0.61

Configuration file parser added. The syntax of oaesis.cnf is the same as
gem.cnf. A lot of the menu handling have been moved to evnthndl.c to speed
things up.

Version 0.62, March 24th 1996.

More applications run; Thing etc. Added debug option to configuration file;
By default debug messages are printed to /dev/stderr, but with the command:
DEBUG = <device> the output can be redirected. If you want to use modem2 as
your debug device just write DEBUG = /dev/modem2 in oaesis.cnf.

Version 0.7, April 22nd 1996.

Some memory bugs corrected => better stability. Programs like Superbase
personal II, Interface II (finally), Qed 3.60, Mgif 5.01, BootConf 1.20,
BootXS, STZip, ESSCode, DevPac, Lattice C, Atari Works, ST-Guide, STello,
GemBench, LZHshell and Xedit run now.
Accessories are now started at boot time.

Version 0.71, April 28th 1996.

MasterBrowse and Yukon works.
Fixed bug in Rdwrs_rel_sem() that caused freezing problems.
Change of window colours when topping/bottoming hopefully works
correctly now.
Changed behaviour of form_dial() to make "dirty" written programs work
a little better.

Version 0.72, May 1st 1996

Prgflags now works.
Fixed so that sliders are only redrawn if they were actually changed.
This makes things look and feel smoother. I also ditched the DrawWind
process, and and and... it turned out to be a real hit! oAESis + NVDI
feels really good. It's a pity I can't boot oAESis with NVDI on my
VGA monitor :-/. The WM_REDRAW message sending has been looked over and
improved to minimize the number of messages sent.
New in oaesis.cnf is AE_REALMOVE and AE_REALSIZE. These AES variables
tell oAESis whether to allow realtime resizing and moving of windows.
See the oaesis.cnf example file for more info. Planned is AE_REALSCROLL
to allow realtime scrolling of windows.

Version 0.73, May 8th 1996

Added code for realtime scrolling of windows (jps). AE_REALSLIDE in
oaesis.cnf is used for this purpose. Added clip test to draw_object()
in objc.c => much quicker redraws in, for instance, Thing.

Version 0.74, May 19th 1996

Changed objc_draw() so that Papyrus works.
Added CTRL + ALT + TAB application switching.
Iconification of windows and applications (CTRL-click) supported.
Added application name on window mover.

Version 0.75

Wind_update(BEG_UPDATE) problem solved => Ecopy works better.
Semaphore and pipe names changed to allow oAESis to run under
oAESis => Development of oAESis is now possible under oAESis!
v_opnwk() under NVDI doesn't seem to save the registers it should =>
the VDI handle address was overwritten. The option -R on global.c
seems to solve the problem temporarily.

Version 0.76

If you manually edit the path in the fileselector and press RETURN the
list is updated instead of returning from the call.
The option AE_APPL_WIND in oaesis.cnf is used to turn the application
name on window movers on/off.

Version 0.8

wind_draw() implemented.
shel_envrn() as well as parts of shel_write(SWM_ENVIRON,...) implemented.
Start of TOS programs with u:\pipe\tosrun implemented.
Control + mouseclick in the application menu killsa acc or app.
Added start desktop option in the file menu.

Jan Paul Schmidt:
This weekend I finally sat down and tried once again since a long time
to compile oAESis with gcc. For what is the library "iio" needed? Compiling
with it crashes, without it works fine. I think, compiling with it worked
on earlier source releases. To that, I needed another fix for
the "makefile". When changing "GLOBALVARS" in "global.h" and recompiling
oAESis, it crashes or doesn't work proper, so I added "global.h" everywhere.
Now to the other changes I made. I added several variables for "oaesis.cnf"
(not to mention the code for all that :). They are:

AE_ACC_PATH       - guess what :)
AE_FSEL_SORTED    - internal fileselector shows directory sorted
AE_FSEL_EXTERN    - oAESis ignores fsel calls and pass it to the old handler.
                    External fileselectors can be used, but only with keys.
                    I don't know till now why none of them reacts to mouse
                    clicks. Maybe I have enough time next weekend for that.
AE_GRAF_MBOX      - oAESis ignores the "graf_mbox" call.
AE_GRAF_GROWBOX   - oAESis ignores the "graf_growbox" call.
AE_GRAF_SHRINKBOX - oAESis ignores the "graf_shrinkbox" call.
(to be honest, it's not just that GUI-thing, like feedback's stealing time. I
 was to lazy to redo the code to avoid crashes with huge form dialogs when
 nvdi is not installed ;)
AE_TRACE          - traces AES calls. (your trace code in "docalls.c")
                    Usefull to avoid recompiling. Also non- or lazy programmes
                    could send a bug report, if they redirect AE_DEBUG to
                    a file.

Hope I didn't forget something important.

Unfortunatly I don't have "Interface" or any other RCS, which can read
the new rsc format, so the fileselector will stay this way for now.

I hope there is some need for this changes.

Next time, same channel.
