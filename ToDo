Known bugs:
- The AE_-directives in the configuration file are not supported.
- Shel_do_write needs to be fixed for linux.
- The menu bar is not updated properly when an application is started.
- The menu_register call in the launcher doesn't seem to work.
- "Already present" button state => no click owner check => clicks fall
  through desktop.
- Iconification doesn't work.

Other things to do:
- Check mint emulation flag when loading resource files in rsrc.c and make
  sure that case insensitivity is used when it should.
- Store the top menu apid in a module global variable in srv.c
- Fix srv_wind_set in srv.c and on client side (changeslider, top_window)
- Clean up menu and desktop background code
- Move appliction menu code to the client side (update_appl_menu in srv.c)
- Clean up after applications that die before calling appl_exit()
